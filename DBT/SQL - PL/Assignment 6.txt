1. Write a stored procedure by the name of Comp_intr to calculate the amount of 
interest on a bank account that compounds interest yearly. The formula is:-         
I 
= p (1+ r) y â€“ p    
where:-    
I is the total interest earned.     
p is the principal.           
r is the rate of interest as a decimal less than 1, and    
y  is the number of years the money is earning interest.    
Your stored procedure should accept the values of p, r and y as parameters and insert 
the Interest and Total amount into tempp table.      

mysql> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tempp (
    ->     Interest DECIMAL(15,2),
    ->     TotalAmount DECIMAL(15,2)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> DELIMITER //
mysql>
mysql> CREATE PROCEDURE Comp_intr(
    ->     IN p DECIMAL(15,2),
    ->     IN r DECIMAL(5,4),
    ->     IN y INT
    -> )
    -> BEGIN
    ->     DECLARE interest DECIMAL(15,2);
    ->     DECLARE total_amount DECIMAL(15,2);
    ->
    ->     SET interest = (p * POW((1 + r), y)) - p;
    ->
    ->     SET total_amount = p + interest;
    ->
    ->     INSERT INTO tempp (Interest, TotalAmount)
    ->     VALUES (interest, total_amount);
    -> END //
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

2. Create a stored function by the name of Age_calc.  Your stored function should 
accept the date of birth of a person as a parameter.  The stored function should 
calculate the age of the person in years. The stored function should return the age 
in years.   

mysql> CREATE FUNCTION Age_calc(dob DATE)
    -> RETURNS INT
    -> DETERMINISTIC
    -> BEGIN
    ->     DECLARE age INT;
    ->
    ->     SET age = TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, dob, CURDATE());
    ->
    ->     RETURN age;
    -> END //
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT Age_calc('2000-05-15') AS AgeInYears;
+------------+
| AgeInYears |
+------------+
|         24 |
+------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
