1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of cnum and snum are different from one 
another, and so that NULL values are excluded from the date field.

	CREATE TABLE Orders (
    onum INT UNIQUE,
    cnum INT NOT NULL,
    snum INT NOT NULL,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT unique_cnum_snum UNIQUE (cnum, snum)
    );

2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no NULLS permitted, 
snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).

	CREATE TABLE Salespeople (
    snum INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    commission DECIMAL(5, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.10,
    CHECK (name >= 'A' AND name <= 'M')
    );


3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, and the cnum is greater that the snum. 
Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.

	CREATE TABLE Orders (
    onum INT NOT NULL,
    cnum INT NOT NULL,
    snum INT NOT NULL,
    CHECK (onum > cnum AND cnum > snum)
    );
