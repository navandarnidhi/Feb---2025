1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named 
Cisneros. Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum). 

mysql> SELECT *
    -> FROM Orders
    -> WHERE Cnum = (SELECT Cnum FROM Customers WHERE Cname = 'Cisneros');
+------+---------+------------+------+------+
| Onum | Amt     | Odate      | Cnum | Snum |
+------+---------+------------+------+------+
| 3001 |   18.69 | 1990-10-03 | 2008 | 1007 |
| 3006 | 1098.16 | 1990-10-03 | 2008 | 1007 |
+------+---------+------------+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.04 sec)

2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have 
above-average orders. 

mysql> SELECT Cname, Rating
    -> FROM Customers
    -> WHERE Rating > (SELECT AVG(Rating) FROM Customers);
+----------+--------+
| Cname    | Rating |
+----------+--------+
| Giovanni |    200 |
| Liu      |    200 |
| Grass    |    300 |
| Cisneros |    300 |
+----------+--------+
4 rows in set (0.02 sec)

3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for 
whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table. 

mysql> SELECT Snum, SUM(Amt) AS Total_Amount
    -> FROM Orders
    -> GROUP BY Snum
    -> HAVING SUM(Amt) > (SELECT MAX(Amt) FROM Orders);
+------+--------------+
| Snum | Total_Amount |
+------+--------------+
| 1001 |     15382.07 |
+------+--------------+
1 row in set (0.03 sec)
