1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the Orders table quickly.

SELECT order_date, COUNT(*) FROM Orders GROUP BY order_date;

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be unique 
(assume all current values are unique)?

ALTER TABLE Orders ADD CONSTRAINT unique_onum UNIQUE (onum);

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders grouped by date quickly.

CREATE INDEX idx_salesperson_date ON Orders (salesperson_id, order_date);

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, and that this is currently the case. 
Enter a command that enforces it.

ALTER TABLE Customers ADD CONSTRAINT unique_salesperson_rating UNIQUE (salesperson_id, rating);
