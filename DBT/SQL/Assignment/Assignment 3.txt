1. Does ANSI recognize the data type DATE?
ANSI (American National Standards Institute) does recognize the DATE data type.
It’s part of the standard SQL data types.
DATE is used to store date values (like '2025-04-10'), without time information.

2. Which subdivision of SQL is used to insert values in tables?
The subdivision is DML — Data Manipulation Language.
It includes commands like:
INSERT (to add rows)
UPDATE (to modify rows)
DELETE (to remove rows)
SELECT (to retrieve data)
 So to insert values into a table, you’d use:
INSERT INTO TableName (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
