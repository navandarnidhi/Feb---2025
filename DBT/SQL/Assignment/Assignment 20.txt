1) Which of these views are updateable (will allow DML operations)?
#1

CREATE VIEW Dailyorders
AS SELECT DISTINCT cnum, snum, onum, odate from Orders;

CREATE VIEW Dailyorders AS  SELECT DISTINCT cnum, snum, onum, odate from Orders;

#2

Create View Custotals
as Select cname, Sum (amt) Sum_Amt from Orders, Customers
where Orders.cnum=Customers.cnum Group by cname;

Create View Custotals as Select cname, Sum(amt) Sum_Amt  from Orders, Customers 
where Orders.cnum=Customers.cnum Group by cname;

#3
Create view Thirdorders
as Select * from Dailyorders where odate=’1990-10-03’;

Create view Thirdorders as Select * from Dailyorders where odate='1990-10-03';

#4
Create view Nullcities
as Select snum, sname, city
from Salespeople where city is NULL
OR sname BETWEEN ‘A’ and ‘MZ’;

Create view Nullcities as Select snum, sname, city from Salespeople where city is NULL OR sname BETWEEN 'A' and 'MZ';

2) Create a view of the Salespeople table called Commissions. This view will include only the snum and comm fields. 
Through this view, someone could enter or change commissions, but only to values between .10 and .20.

CREATE VIEW Commissions AS SELECT snum, commission AS comm FROM Salespeople;

CREATE TRIGGER CheckCommissionRange 
BEFORE UPDATE ON Commissions
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.comm < 0.10 OR NEW.comm > 0.20 THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Commission must be between 0.10 and 0.20';
    END IF;
END;

3) Some SQL implementations have a built-in constant representing the current date, sometimes called “CURDATE” or “SYSDATE”. The word SYSDATE can therefore be used in a SQL statement, and be replaced by the current date when the value is accessed by commands such as Select or Insert. We will use a view of the Orders table called Entryorders to insert rows into the Orders table. Create the Orders table, so that SYSDATE is automatically inserted for odate if no value is given. Then create the Entryorders view so that no values can be given.
    CREATE TABLE Orders (
    onum INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cnum INT NOT NULL,
    snum INT NOT NULL,
    amt DECIMAL(10, 2),
    odate DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE,  -- Use SYSDATE as the default value
    FOREIGN KEY (cnum) REFERENCES Customers(cnum),
    FOREIGN KEY (snum) REFERENCES Salespeople(snum)
    );
