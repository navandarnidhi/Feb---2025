 Using Subqueries with DML Commands.
1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions 
as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one 
customer into this table. 

mysql> CREATE TABLE Multicust (
    ->     Snum INT,
    ->     Sname VARCHAR(10),
    ->     City VARCHAR(10),
    ->     Comm FLOAT(3,2)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.05 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO Multicust (Snum, Sname, City, Comm)
    -> SELECT Snum, Sname, City, Comm
    -> FROM Salespeople
    -> WHERE Snum IN (SELECT Snum FROM Orders GROUP BY Snum HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Cnum) > 1);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)
Records: 1  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders. 

mysql> DELETE FROM Customers
    -> WHERE Cnum NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT Cnum FROM Orders);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)

3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all 
salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.

mysql> UPDATE Salespeople
    -> SET Comm = Comm * 1.20
    -> WHERE Snum IN (
    ->     SELECT Snum
    ->     FROM Orders
    ->     GROUP BY Snum
    ->     HAVING SUM(Amt) > 3000
    -> );
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0
