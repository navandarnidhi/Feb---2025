1)	Which field of the Customers table is the primary key?
CustomerID is the primary key — it uniquely identifies each customer in the table.

2)	What is the 4th column of the Customers table?
The 4th column is Country, assuming the table follows the standard order:

CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Country

3)	What is another word for row? For column?
Another word for row: Record
Another word for Column:Field

4)	Why isn’t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
It's not possible unless you explicitly request it using a SQL query.
Tables in relational databases do not have a guaranteed order by default, and simply opening a table doesn't automatically show only the first five rows. To see them, you would use a query like:

SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 5;

Or in SQL Server:

SELECT TOP 5 * FROM Customers;
